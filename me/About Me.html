<h1>Hello World, I'm David
     
</h1>
<hr />
<p>My full name is Felix David Nuyete. I am a 6 foot 2 inches tall guy from Nigeria. I am an open-minded and adventurous individual that is always open to new experiences and likes to appreciate every waking moment; for the most part. I am a human who also has his bad days when he wakes up wishing for oblivion, but this is part of the human experience and I always get past it.
</p>
<p>I got into programming in my mid twenties. I had heard a lot about programming before then but couldn't properly learn and practice it because I didn't have a laptop. I eventually bought one a year later and bought an depth course into programming online and never looked back. It has been a life changing experience for me so far.</p>
<p>I like to read novels in my spare time and stargaze if it's in the night time. I am also really into fitness and learning foreign languages. I also watch a lot of movies on my off-days from work.</p>
